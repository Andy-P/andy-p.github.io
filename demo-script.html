          <h1>Welcome to Minds, Markets and Machines</h1>

<p>Wherein, we take a casual stroll through the intersection of <code>machine learning</code>, <code>quantitative analysis</code>, 
and <code>functional programming</code>. I work in the field of what is now often called 'alpha discovery'.
If you're not sure what that means, just think <code>data science for finance</code>.</p>

<p>Like data science in general, it encompasses a number of domains:</p>

<ul>
<li>Math</li>
<li>Statistics analysis</li>
<li>Machine learning</li>
<li>Diverse programming skills</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>It goes a bit further. To do it really well, you really need an understanding of</p>

<ul>
<li>Behavioral economics</li>
<li>Market structure (financial domain knowledge)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prepare to be tested (aka “Your pedigree means nothing”)</h2>

<p>It often feels like Kaggle only with more painful feedback.
If you model doesn’t work out, you get a slap in the 'pnl face' from the market.
Oh... and there’s plenty of feedback to go around.</p>

<h2>Actionable decisions from distant feedback</h2>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, it is about creating models that produce 
immediately actionable decisions where the feedback is distant in 
time from the inputs used to make those decisions. In that sense, 
it seems <code>closer to robotics than data science</code>.</p>

<h2>Wait... What's functional programming got to do with it?</h2>

<p>Functional programming in uniquely suited to the task. There is of course
all the stuff you hear about functional programming that is true for any domain.</p>

<ul>
<li>Clean, concise code leading to fewer bugs and easier maintenance</li>
<li>Immutability by default, which prevents a large class of errors.</li>
<li>Concurrency - asynchronous programming is very easy, as is parallelism.</li>
<li>Domain modelling is very easy and explicit</li>
</ul>

<br> 

<p>But there is one aspect that is seems under appreciated in my field.</p>
